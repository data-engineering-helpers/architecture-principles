Data platform - Architecture principles
=======================================

# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/architecture-principles)
intends to collaborate on specifying architecture principles and diagrams
for a typical data platform with the so-called Modern Data Stack (MDS).

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
