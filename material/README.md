## Principles - Orchestration

### Don't use Apache Airflow in that way
* Title: Don’t Use Apache Airflow in That Way
* Date: May 2023
* Author: Ansam Yousry (

* Link to the article:
  https://medium.com/illumination/what-apache-airflow-is-not-e9dc9722500b
* Publisher: Medium
* Summary: Airflow is not a data streaming or processing tool, but it is a good orchestrator
  for managing data pipelines. Airflow integrates well with specialized data tools, allowing building
  complete and scalable data pipeline solutions

## Principles - Documentation

### Atlassian - The importance of documentation
* Title: The importance of documentation (because it’s way more than a formality)
* Link to the page:
  https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation
* Publisher: Atlassian
* Documentation should be your best friend:
  + A single source of truth saves time and energy
  + Documentation is essential to quality and process control
  + Documentation cuts down duplicative work
  + It makes hiring and onboarding so much easier
  + A single source of truth makes everyone smarter

### Doc as Code
* Title: Docs as Code
* Author: [Eric Holscher](https://ericholscher.com/)
* Link to the page:
  https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/
* Publisher: [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)
* Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation
  with the same tools as code:
  + Issue Trackers
  + Version Control (Git)
  + Plain Text Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc)
  + Code Reviews
  + Automated Tests
* This means following the same workflows as development teams, and being integrated in the product team.
  It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation, and work together
  to make it as good as possible.

## Clean architecture
One of the main principles of clean architecture is nothing more than keeping your options open by changing,
adding, or removing dependencies as often as you want. We offer two analogies to illustrate this point.
A good demo project can be found on
[GitHub by Mattia Battiston](https://github.com/mattia-battiston/clean-architecture-example).
