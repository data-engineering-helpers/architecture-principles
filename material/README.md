* Publisher: Medium
* Summary: Airflow is not a data streaming or processing tool, but it is a good orchestrator
  for managing data pipelines. Airflow integrates well with specialized data tools, allowing building
  complete and scalable data pipeline solutions

### Principles - Documentation

#### Atlassian - The importance of documentation
* Title: The importance of documentation (because it’s way more than a formality)
* Link to the page:
  https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/knowledge-sharing/documentation/importance-of-documentation
* Publisher: Atlassian
* Documentation should be your best friend:
  + A single source of truth saves time and energy
  + Documentation is essential to quality and process control
  + Documentation cuts down duplicative work
  + It makes hiring and onboarding so much easier
  + A single source of truth makes everyone smarter
